I can already hear the question: “Why don’t you just get LinkedIn, like everyone else?”

The answer is fairly straightforward. I’m not particularly fond of the current social media landscape. Much of it functions less as a space for genuine connection or professional exchange, and more as a marketing ecosystem that rewards visibility over substance. Behind the scenes, user data is routinely collected and repurposed — whether for targeted advertising, training AI systems, or feeding opaque data markets.

This site exists as a conscious alternative.

Here, I am not optimising for reach, engagement metrics, or algorithmic approval. I can present my work and ideas in a way that feels deliberate and honest, without compressing them into predefined templates or polishing them for performative professionalism. I decide what is shown, how it is structured, and what level of detail is appropriate.

There is also a practical motivation. Building and maintaining this site allows me to stay in touch with my coding skills, to develop them further, and to work in formats that emphasise reproducibility and clarity. The process itself matters to me: it is intellectually engaging, creatively satisfying, and closely aligned with how I prefer to think and work.
